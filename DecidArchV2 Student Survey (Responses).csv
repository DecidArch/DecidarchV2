11/26/2018 12:50:13,Strongly Agree,"Overall after 3 concern cards we really only assessed the impact of the + and - on the overall score and not what these options really meant or if the values for these options are plausible.

Then the players individual score could be assessed on the accuracy of estimations. Of course, this only can work if nobody knows the game makers' proposed values before.",Strongly Disagree,"The aim of the game is to meet and improve the overall score. The players find out very quickly, that they can maximize not by reasoning but by just choosing and counting cleverly the impacts without reasoning at all about the available options. In one of our concerns we had even mutually exclusive options to previously chosen (e.g. storing locally vs. storing externally), which was said to be outside the scope of the game. Overall the templates then were useless as there is no incentive to document as the reasons to take an option are always only ""maximizes the result for the current state of results.""",Strongly Disagree,See remarks for 2.,Strongly Disagree,See 2.

I wouldn't say that this is reasoning.",Strongly Agree,"Yes, but that also meant that the individual evaluation part was lacking a lot. Not only was there not enough time to individually assess the options but it didn't make any sense to individually assess and document and then discuss as - as stated above - the goal of the game was to have a high score and often as the values present themselves deciding for one option is based only on a quantitative and comparative analysis. So there was no real reasoning and discussing behind it.",Strongly Disagree,See above.,Strongly Disagree,See above.,Strongly Disagree,With the choices that we took maintainability was high before the event raised the importance of maintainability ,Strongly Disagree,See above.,Strongly Disagree,See above.,Strongly Disagree,See above.,Agree,"Yes, but I was disappointed as it eventually turned only into a impact score counting game and what to me is not the gist of software architecture which I find to be to come up and assess architectural decisions and use well known tools and techniques to do that",Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Disagree,"I find that the order of quality attributes should be maintained throughout every appearance. Often we felt that filling out the sheets the order was always different, e.g. in one instance Security was after Availability and in the other instance Availability came before Security. When filling out the scores in the sheets and reading off the impact from concern cards this is a minor nuisance.",We did not address all concerns.,We were lacking 3 concern cards.,King of Clubs,Computer Science Internet & Web Technology,No,No,No,,To count up + and - ,"See my suggestions above. I liked the game approach a lot, but so far the game doesn't achieve what it aims for - to be a game about software architecture. I would propose to remove the part about individually assessing the alternatives and straight up just provide a starting point for discussion by providing 2-3 alternatives to choose from at the concern cards without providing impacts of the three alternatives. The group then has to come up by discussion with the impacts of a decision. After some point in the game (maybe at the end or when a event card was drawn) the actual impacts which are thought of by the games makers' is revealed. A wrong assessment would then e.g. lead to point losses or punish otherwise. This gives players reason to actually reason and learn about how the metric of their decisions is. Also I think that there were too many concern cards for 30 min."
